# zookeepr

## User Story
`AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete`

## Instructions
Create a web server using the Express.js framework and add it to a front-end application that the local zoo is developing, called Zoo Keepr. The siteâ€™s data will live on the server you build so that anyone can access it without having to download it. Youâ€™ll also deploy your application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
